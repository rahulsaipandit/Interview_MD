Question 1 - “Tell me about yourself”
Why ? – Daniel Branik (previous CIO at Arinex) “It’s a great way to warm up the conversation and it helps me understand how they communicate. Are you concise and direct? Or are you a storyteller? Are you entertaining? Do you go off on tangents?"

Jason Ferriggi (CIO at Outcome Health) “For me the most important part of any interview is understanding whether the applicant is a good personality and cultural fit for the team and organisation. Therefore I place plenty of emphasis on the question “tell me about yourself”. I can spend money on training and developing the skills I need, however there is little I can do about personality and how well the new applicant fits the existing team. I always follow up a successful first round interview with an informal team catch up and then stand back and observe the body language and indirect communication that takes place. From this I generally have a good idea of who will be the right person for the job."


Question 2 – “What is one thing that you would like to change about yourself and why?”
Why ? – Matt Gurrie (CIO at Hansen Technologies) “It gives insight to that a candidate understands what their weaknesses are and what they want to do to improve themselves. It also gives insight into how a candidate thinks and responds to a question they are not likely to get asked.”


Question 3 – “If you had a blank sheet of paper to write down your ultimate role, what would it be?”
Why ? – Jeremy Bree (CIO at Henley Properties) "Helps to understand if they are just serving you the lines you want to hear (nobodies’ ultimate role is Level 1/2 Help Desk) or are they comfortable enough to tell me that they would much prefer to be the Manager of Liverpool but understand the realities of life and this is where they are (until Liverpool call then all bets are off)."


Question 4 - “Tell me about one key project/initiative you were involved in and tell me how you made a positive impact on the outcome? What value did you provide and how did you make a difference?”

Why ? – David Pare (CTO Healthcare & Lifesciences at CSC) – “In a previous role, I used to help organisations define and setup their Enterprise Architecture Center of Excellence or function. I used to hire various level of architects, from enterprise and strategy to solution and technology. This question was very useful to assess the level of actual involvement the candidate had in the project. Many people work on great, complex and large programs of work but they often had a very limited role on it. If they can present a concise, clear and educated view of the project, it usually means the person actually worked on it to a deeper degree.

Pointing to a whiteboard and markers, I then ask the following question: “Can you draw a conceptual view of your project and walk me through it?”

Some people are destabilized when being put on the spot but this allows me to test the candidate’s communication skills and his/her ability to conceptualise and communicate effectively in a concise manner. It does not really matter what they draw as long as they can tell a good and structured story, emphasizing on their actual role.

Although these questions work well for architects, I found that it also worked great with a variety other IT roles like operations manager, strategy, designer, developer, tester, infrastructure manager, project manager, change manager and others. I believe being able to communicate efficiently and conceptualizing ideas are skills required by everyone."


Question 5 (specific to Penetration Testers) – “How would you typically go around getting Domain Admin privilege on an internal penetration test?”
Why ? – Arni Mar Hardarson (CTO Victoria at Pure Hacking) “My favourite interview questions involve questions that demonstrate out-of-the-box thinking as that is a key aspect of what a Penetration Tester requires in his daily activity."


Question 6 – “It is Friday afternoon and you are looking back on a successful week. Please describe the activities you have undertaken and why they contributed to the success of the organisation.”

Why ? – David Black (CIO at Metro North Hospital and Health Service) “It gets a candidate to talk about the context of the role and what they perceive creates value. I don’t think there is a correct or otherwise answer. It can be insightful if the interview panel drills down on a particular topic that a candidate is not explaining well.”


Question 7 – “Tell me about a time where you backed yourself to do something and what was the outcome?”
Why ? – Michael Foreshew (CIO at Montague) “This question really made me think as a lot of the interviews up that point had followed a largely similar situation/outcome approach. This question was in the same vein but was looking for something a bit different. In answering the question I was afforded an opportunity to review all of the things that I had done in my working career and evaluate them from a different perspective. To my mind also, the question was not about the outcome but rather my approach and learnings from the situation. Whilst the question itself was looking for a different response, it was only after the interview did I come to realise just what an insightful question it was. The interviewer was obviously interested in my response but it signalled to me that here was an interviewer, a potential employer, asking how do you extend yourself and regardless of the outcome (success or failure) learn and move on. It showed what I thought was an incredibly self-aware organisation and one that promoted a realistic approach to advancing the organisation as well as the individual. With that approach, this was an organisation I really wanted to work for.

The other thing I learned from being asked this question, especially as I conduct my own recruitment process, was the importance of framing interview questions correctly. The type of questions that an interviewer asks of a candidate tells volumes about the type of organisation and its people.”


Question 8 – “What accomplishment in your career to date are you most proud of?”
Why ? – Jonathan Eastgate (CTO at The simPRO Group) “It tells me a lot about the candidate – what motivates them, how they like to work (task or action based) and what success looks like to them. It also usually encompasses them telling me about working as an individual or as part of a team and how they responded to that. These are all quite different for every candidate. These are very important components to an employees feeling of engagement and as such can be used as a cornerstone of keeping them engaged in their new role if they get it."
