# CIO/CTO Interview Questions

## Question 1 - "Tell me about yourself"

## Answer 1 - "Tell me about yourself"
I'm a transformational engineering leader with 15+ years of experience in AI/ML-driven product innovation. Currently VP Engineering at Augment Me, where I grew our AI-first product from MVP to TechCrunch Top 200 and Stanford StartX selection. Previously led engineering at Visible Wireless, tripling revenue from $13M to $39M, and at Amazon where I built Alexa AI services and Rentals platform. I'm passionate about scaling mission-critical systems and driving innovation through strategic technical leadership.

**Why?** - Daniel Branik (previous CIO at Arinex) "It's a great way to warm up the conversation and it helps me understand how they communicate. Are you concise and direct? Or are you a storyteller? Are you entertaining? Do you go off on tangents?"

**Why?** - Jason Ferriggi (CIO at Outcome Health) "For me the most important part of any interview is understanding whether the applicant is a good personality and cultural fit for the team and organisation. Therefore I place plenty of emphasis on the question 'tell me about yourself'. I can spend money on training and developing the skills I need, however there is little I can do about personality and how well the new applicant fits the existing team. I always follow up a successful first round interview with an informal team catch up and then stand back and observe the body language and indirect communication that takes place. From this I generally have a good idea of who will be the right person for the job."

## Question 2 - "What is one thing that you would like to change about yourself and why?"
## Answer 2 - "What is one thing that you would like to change about yourself and why?"
I would enhance my ability to delegate more effectively during high-pressure situations. While my hands-on approach has driven successful outcomes, I've learned that empowering teams earlier in the process allows for greater scalability and develops leadership capabilities throughout the organization, ultimately creating more sustainable growth.

**Why?** - Matt Gurrie (CIO at Hansen Technologies) "It gives insight to that a candidate understands what their weaknesses are and what they want to do to improve themselves. It also gives insight into how a candidate thinks and responds to a question they are not likely to get asked."

## Question 3 - "If you had a blank sheet of paper to write down your ultimate role, what would it be?"
## Answer 3 - "If you had a blank sheet of paper to write down your ultimate role, what would it be?"
Chief Technology Officer of a Fortune 500 company, leading global technology transformation initiatives that leverage AI/ML to drive enterprise innovation and operational excellence at scale.

**Why?** - Jeremy Bree (CIO at Henley Properties) "Helps to understand if they are just serving you the lines you want to hear (nobodies' ultimate role is Level 1/2 Help Desk) or are they comfortable enough to tell me that they would much prefer to be the Manager of Liverpool but understand the realities of life and this is where they are (until Liverpool call then all bets are off)."

## Question 4 - "Tell me about one key project/initiative you were involved in and tell me how you made a positive impact on the outcome? What value did you provide and how did you make a difference?"

## Answer 4 - "Tell me about one key project/initiative you were involved in and tell me how you made a positive impact on the outcome? What value did you provide and how did you make a difference?"
At Visible Wireless, I led the complete digital transformation from physical stores to AI/ML-powered digital-first platform. I established the technical vision, built a 60+ person global team, and drove revenue growth from $13M to $39M in 2 years. The value I provided was strategic alignment between business objectives and technical execution, resulting in 30% operational cost reduction and establishment of a Center of Excellence for secure, high-performing applications.


**Why?** - David Pare (CTO Healthcare & Lifesciences at CSC) "In a previous role, I used to help organisations define and setup their Enterprise Architecture Center of Excellence or function. I used to hire various level of architects, from enterprise and strategy to solution and technology. This question was very useful to assess the level of actual involvement the candidate had in the project. Many people work on great, complex and large programs of work but they often had a very limited role on it. If they can present a concise, clear and educated view of the project, it usually means the person actually worked on it to a deeper degree.

Pointing to a whiteboard and markers, I then ask the following question: 'Can you draw a conceptual view of your project and walk me through it?'

Some people are destabilized when being put on the spot but this allows me to test the candidate's communication skills and his/her ability to conceptualise and communicate effectively in a concise manner. It does not really matter what they draw as long as they can tell a good and structured story, emphasizing on their actual role.

Although these questions work well for architects, I found that it also worked great with a variety other IT roles like operations manager, strategy, designer, developer, tester, infrastructure manager, project manager, change manager and others. I believe being able to communicate efficiently and conceptualizing ideas are skills required by everyone."

## Question 5 (specific to Penetration Testers) - "How would you typically go around getting Domain Admin privilege on an internal penetration test?"

## Answer 5 - "How would you typically go around getting Domain Admin privilege on an internal penetration test?"
While not my primary expertise, I would approach this systematically: first reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, then exploit common weaknesses like misconfigured services or weak passwords, potentially using tools like Mimikatz for credential harvesting, followed by lateral movement through the network to escalate privileges to Domain Admin level.

**Why?** - Arni Mar Hardarson (CTO Victoria at Pure Hacking) "My favourite interview questions involve questions that demonstrate out-of-the-box thinking as that is a key aspect of what a Penetration Tester requires in his daily activity."

## Question 6 - "It is Friday afternoon and you are looking back on a successful week. Please describe the activities you have undertaken and why they contributed to the success of the organisation."

**Why?** - David Black (CIO at Metro North Hospital and Health Service) "It gets a candidate to talk about the context of the role and what they perceive creates value. I don't think there is a correct or otherwise answer. It can be insightful if the interview panel drills down on a particular topic that a candidate is not explaining well."

## Answer 6 - "It is Friday afternoon and you are looking back on a successful week. Please describe the activities you have undertaken and why they contributed to the success of the organisation."
This week I aligned our AI product strategy with business objectives, mentored three senior engineers on leadership development, resolved a critical infrastructure scaling issue that improved system uptime by 15%, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to accelerate our product roadmap. These activities contributed to organizational success by ensuring technical excellence, team growth, operational reliability, and strategic alignment that drives revenue and innovation.

## Question 7 - "Tell me about a time where you backed yourself to do something and what was the outcome?"

## Answer 7 - "Tell me about a time where you backed yourself to do something and what was the outcome?"
At Amazon, I backed myself to establish the Alexa Name-Free 3P Skill experience from scratch, despite skepticism about market readiness. I assembled a 45-person team, developed the AI/ML infrastructure, and launched the service. The outcome was transformative - it became a cornerstone of Alexa's ecosystem, driving significant user engagement and establishing me as a strategic innovator within the organization.

**Why?** - Michael Foreshew (CIO at Montague) "This question really made me think as a lot of the interviews up that point had followed a largely similar situation/outcome approach. This question was in the same vein but was looking for something a bit different. In answering the question I was afforded an opportunity to review all of the things that I had done in my working career and evaluate them from a different perspective. To my mind also, the question was not about the outcome but rather my approach and learnings from the situation. Whilst the question itself was looking for a different response, it was only after the interview did I come to realise just what an insightful question it was. The interviewer was obviously interested in my response but it signalled to me that here was an interviewer, a potential employer, asking how do you extend yourself and regardless of the outcome (success or failure) learn and move on. It showed what I thought was an incredibly self-aware organisation and one that promoted a realistic approach to advancing the organisation as well as the individual. With that approach, this was an organisation I really wanted to work for.

The other thing I learned from being asked this question, especially as I conduct my own recruitment process, was the importance of framing interview questions correctly. The type of questions that an interviewer asks of a candidate tells volumes about the type of organisation and its people."

## Question 8 - "What accomplishment in your career to date are you most proud of?"

## Answer 8 - "What accomplishment in your career to date are you most proud of?"
Leading Visible Wireless' digital transformation that tripled revenue in 2 years while building a high-performing global team and establishing operational excellence. This accomplishment demonstrated my ability to drive strategic vision, execute complex technical transformations, and create sustainable organizational change that delivers measurable business impact.

**Why?** - Jonathan Eastgate (CTO at The simPRO Group) "It tells me a lot about the candidate - what motivates them, how they like to work (task or action based) and what success looks like to them. It also usually encompasses them telling me about working as an individual or as part of a team and how they responded to that. These are all quite different for every candidate. These are very important components to an employees feeling of engagement and as such can be used as a cornerstone of keeping them engaged in their new role if they get it."
