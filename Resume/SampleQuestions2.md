# High-Level CTO Interview Questions

## 1. How do you measure your success?
## Answer 1 - How do you measure your success?
I measure success through three key metrics: business impact (revenue growth, cost reduction), team development (retention, promotion rates), and technical innovation (product launches, architectural improvements). At Visible Wireless, success was tripling revenue while reducing costs 30% and building a high-performing team.

Everyone has a different idea of what it means to be successful. If the candidate's vision of success is similar to ours, we'll all feel satisfied when a project is finished.

## 2. What brought you here?
## Answer 2 - What brought you here?
My journey from engineering management at Amazon to executive leadership at startups and enterprises has been driven by a passion for scaling AI/ML solutions. Each role built upon the last - from Alexa AI services to digital transformation at Visible Wireless to AI-first product development at Augment Me - preparing me for CTO-level strategic technology leadership.

Anyone can hand me a resume and let me read about their career history. I'm looking for someone who can explain how their past experience led them to their current career path.

## 3. Pitch what we do.
## Answer 3 - Pitch what we do.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides the most comprehensive and secure cloud platform for enterprise workloads, enabling organizations to innovate faster, reduce costs, and scale globally with AI-powered services, multi-cloud capabilities, and industry-leading performance.

Every executive employee should be able to represent the business in public. If the candidate can create a sales pitch for your company during the interview, you'll find out if they can handle speaking on your company's behalf.

## 4. What is one thing you would want to change about the company right now?
This question shows me how much the candidate has thought about my business and how much research they did before the interview. I'm looking for a thoughtful answer, not just something they think I want to hear.

## Answer 4 - What is one thing you would want to change about the company right now?
I would accelerate AI/ML integration across all enterprise applications to drive productivity gains. Oracle has tremendous AI capabilities that could be more deeply embedded in Fusion Cloud applications to give customers immediate competitive advantages.


## 5. What are five words you would use to describe your personality?
## Answer 5 - What are five words you would use to describe your personality?
Strategic, collaborative, innovative, resilient, empowering.

I like this question because it lets me see who the candidate is. If they struggle to come up with enough words, or they come up with too many, it speaks volumes about who they are as a person. Likewise, the words they pick give me an idea of which personal qualities they look for in others.

## 6. What was your production measurement in your last job?
## Answer 6 - What was your production measurement in your last job?
At Augment Me, I measured production through user engagement metrics (30-40% improvement in focus/class results), subscription growth, and technical KPIs like system uptime (99.9%) and development velocity (features shipped per sprint).

This is a really easy question that tells me how critically they think about their work.

## 7. Tell us 3 things you like and 3 things you dislike about your current job.
## Answer 7 - Tell us 3 things you like and 3 things you dislike about your current job.
**Likes:** 1) Driving AI innovation at scale, 2) Building and mentoring high-performing teams, 3) Solving complex technical challenges that impact millions of users.
**Dislikes:** 1) Budget constraints limiting R&D investment, 2) Legacy system integration challenges, 3) Rapidly changing regulatory environments affecting product development timelines.

This question tells me a lot about someone's work persona. If they only have bad things to say about their current position, or if their dislikes seem trivial, it could be a problem. I need to be sure they'll fit in with the company's culture.

## 8. Tell me about a time where you identified a serious problem in the workplace and came up with a solution that benefitted your company.
## Answer 8 - Tell me about a time where you identified a serious problem in the workplace and came up with a solution that benefitted your company.
At Visible Wireless, I identified that our monolithic architecture was limiting scalability. I led the transformation to a modern 5G modular architecture, reducing operational costs by 30% and establishing a Center of Excellence that improved application performance and security, directly contributing to our revenue growth from $13M to $39M.

Problem solving skills are essential for a CFO. I want to make sure the person I hire has proven their ability to diagnose and fix technical problems. I can use their answer to get a better idea of what they do in tough situations and if it will work in my office.

## 9. How have you used new technology to help your employer?
## Answer 9 - How have you used new technology to help your employer?
At Amazon, I pioneered the use of Deep Neural Networks in Alexa's Natural Language Understanding, creating the first Name-Free 3P Skill experience. This AI innovation transformed how users interact with Alexa and became a cornerstone of the platform's ecosystem growth.

Technology is rapidly advancing. I need to make sure my chief technology officer follows new innovations and isn't afraid to try them out. If they have been able to successful use new ideas in the past, it makes me confident that they will be able to do the same in my organization.

## 10. What books and blogs are you currently reading?
## Answer 10 - What books and blogs are you currently reading?
Currently reading "The Phoenix Project" for DevOps insights, following Andreessen Horowitz's AI newsletter, and studying research papers on transformer architectures and large language models to stay ahead of AI advancements.

What someone reads can tell you a lot about what they enjoy and what they aspire to become.

## 11. Ask questions to determine cultural fit.

## Answer 11 - Ask questions to determine cultural fit.
What are the core values that guide decision-making at Oracle? How does Oracle balance innovation with operational stability? What opportunities exist for cross-functional collaboration between engineering and business teams?

It's not enough to hire someone talented; they have to fit in with the company's culture, too. It's important ask questions that reflect the company's culture and purpose. That way, I can tell if a candidate shares the same goals as the company.

## 12. How do you use communication skills?

## Answer 12 - How do you use communication skills?
I adapt my communication style to the audience - executive summaries for C-suite, technical deep-dives for engineering teams, and clear business cases for stakeholders. Regular town halls, one-on-ones, and cross-functional reviews ensure alignment and transparency across all levels.

Someone in a leadership position needs to be able to communicate with employees on all levels of the organization. This is critical for a CTO.

## 13. What is the most complicated assignment you have done?

## Answer 13 - What is the most complicated assignment you have done?
Leading Visible Wireless' complete digital transformation from physical stores to AI/ML-powered platform. This involved migrating legacy systems, building global teams, establishing new processes, and driving cultural change while maintaining business continuity and tripling revenue in 2 years.

This question gives the candidate a chance to show me how they rise to meet challenges. I'm also looking to see how they solve problems: do they break them down or tackle them all at once?

## 14. Tell me what we do in your own words.

## Answer 14 - Tell me what we do in your own words.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure empowers enterprises to build, run, and scale applications with unmatched security, performance, and AI capabilities. We provide the foundation that allows businesses to innovate rapidly while maintaining operational excellence and cost efficiency.

How easily a candidate can sum up the company's purpose and impact shows me how much they already know about the organization. The best candidates we've hired have done research on our company, our goals, and our impact and gave this question a thoughtful answer during their interview.

## 15. Teach me something I don't already know.
One of my friends says Google executives ask this question a lot during interviews. It makes the candidate think on their feet and give a unusual, creative answer.

## Answer 15 - Teach me something I don't already know.
Did you know that human skin is translucent and allows cameras to capture blood flow information for contactless health monitoring? At Augment Me, we're developing AI that analyzes facial video to measure heart rate variability, providing insights into stress and wellness without any physical sensors.
