# Executive-Grade Sample Answers (Concise, Impactful)

## 1. Tell me about your background and leadership experience.

I have 15+ years of AI/ML driven product and engineering leadership experience in both enterprise and startup environments.

I am currently VP Engineering at Augment Me, which is a Health startup that I grew from MVP to a product shortlisted in TechCrunch Top 200 in 2024 and StartX incubator and in ProductHunt two weeks ago where it landed in #18.

Prior to that, I was Executive Director of the complete engineering division of Visible Wireless, which is a Fortune 100 company leading 80+ people organization, doubling the customer base from MVP stage using AI/ML based Digital First strategy to deliver 30% YoY revenue growth in 2 years.

During my time at Amazon and Microsoft, I led core engineering charters for enterprise divisions delivering over $500+ million in revenue in cloud infrastructure and platform services.

At Augment Me, it is a healthcare (wellness and productivity domain) with AI Agents and EEG based wellness models.

We have a core team of 30 people here with scalable vendor teams supporting us. You must have heard of 1 person billion dollar teams.. That may be the north star but we do a lot more with less.

### Team Structure:
- **Designer**: 1 designer using tools like App Alchemy, Figma AI etc to design
- **PM team**: Started and then scrapped it in favor of Leadership +AI led design
- **iPhone and Android Team**: 3 people + vendors that we can scale up and down using a strategy of RN to build once and deploy for both
- **Web Team**
- **API**: 2 people that mostly do design and critical high performance component implementation + Vendor team
- **Science**: 3 DS people consisting of architect plus vendor support as needed
- **Infra**: 1 architect + Duplo team

One of the most versatile technologies developed for contactless health assessment supporting a classroom scenario and a 30 second video selfie. The computational models were developed by tracking their values with their accuracy and ground truth established via medical-grade scientific instruments found in labs and clinics.

Human skin is translucent, allowing light to penetrate and reflect off layers beneath the surface, which reveals blood flow information in the face. Using a camera, a video is captured and optical imaging technology extracts this data, which is then securely sent to a cloud-based AI engine for analysis. Heart rate (HR) measures the number of heartbeats per minute, while heart rate variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats. HRV is an important indicator of how well the body handles stress.

## 2. Why are you interested in Oracle and this role?

I have been following Oracle for a while now and Oracle OCI recently expanded to over 100 worldwide regions, with Stargate, Generative AI, EHR, Embedded AI (Fusion Cloud Applications) in Cloud Applications etc. OCI has expectations of over 70% growth in FY2026, fueled by AI workload adoption and rising cloud usage.

This will require a strong focus on disaster recovery and multicloud capabilities. These investments by Oracle and its future needs align with my experience driving innovation and AI-First approach to shape the future of cloud infrastructure and scale mission-critical systems.

## 3. Why are you leaving your current position?

At Augment Me, I am very proud of the AI foundational model and the product roll out with intensive vetting through the educational board which we grew from 1 school with a 1 year long test trial and results showing 30-40% improvement in focus and class results. It is now in 3 schools plus a online classroom pilot with a global leader in interactive technology that offers best-in-class integrated hardware and software solutions that simplify and streamline teaching, learning, and communication with real-time collaboration.

That said, the policy changes have constrained educational budgets in the last 1 year and they cannot reliably predict plans for 2-3 years.

I'm seeking a role with broader strategic scope and the opportunity to influence cloud strategy at scale. Oracle's growth trajectory and technical challenges are a strong match for my aspirations.

## 4. What are your key strengths as a leader?

I excel at setting a clear vision and to successfully work with my teams to execute and deliver on those large-scale transformations and charter. These often come with challenges of scale and ambiguity and the ability to take measured risks is key.

My strengths include getting the cross-functional collaboration both at C-Suite level and working with my leaders to drive the vision at the division or group level to achieve a strong buy into the vision, focus on quality, innovation balanced by operational rigor, and last but not the least mentoring and developing future leaders.

## 5. How do your values align with Oracle's mission?

I believe in customer-centricity, innovation and operational excellence, —values that are core to Oracle's culture. I'm committed to fostering high performance inclusive teams and delivering measurable business impact.

## 6. What are your expectations for this role?

I expect to set strategy and future vision for the teams, drive technical and business outcomes, mentor senior leaders, and build scalable processes that support OCI's rapid growth and reliability goals.

## 7. Can you highlight a signature achievement from your resume?

I led the migration of a $500M business line to the cloud, reducing costs by 25% and improving uptime to 99.99%. This required executive alignment, technical leadership, and cross-functional execution.

## 8. Where do you see yourself in five years?

Leading transformative cloud initiatives at Oracle, developing the next generation of leaders, and expanding OCI's market impact.

## 9. What is your management style?

I practice servant leadership—empowering teams, setting clear expectations, and holding myself and others accountable for results. At the same time, I expect all my leaders to be able to roll up their sleeves and be technically savvy to dive deep and understand critical challenges so they can ensure the proposed solutions are viable.

## 10. How do you approach building and leading high-performing teams?

I focus on hiring diverse talent, creating a culture of innovation and accountability in a safe environment. Regular feedback and mentorship are central to my approach.
