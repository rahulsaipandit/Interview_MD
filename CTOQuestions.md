# CTO Interview Questions and Preparation Guide

It is important that you do as much research about the company as you can before the interview. You need to show that you understand the company's technological requirements as they relate to business operations, financial requirements and possible future planning. You could even have some suggestions ready for the panel if a question comes up in the interview that warrants any. It all depends on how well the interview unfolds.

## 1. Tell us about our company. What do we do here?

**Answer:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is the industry's most comprehensive and secure cloud platform, providing enterprises with unmatched performance, security, and AI capabilities. We enable organizations to build, run, and scale applications globally while maintaining operational excellence and cost efficiency. OCI's unique value proposition lies in our AI-powered services, multi-cloud capabilities, and industry-leading security that allows businesses to innovate faster and scale mission-critical workloads with confidence.

## Notes
This is quite curveball for a first question, but it does happen from time to time. If you have been considered for such a high-ranking position in the company, then you might have had some preliminary discussions with a company contact ahead of time, or with a recruiter if you have gone through an agency. Either way, they could help you with some key points that you should definitely have prepared for the interview.

The interviewer generally wants to gauge how well you know the business, as it shows that you have taken a key interest in how the organization operates, and what they need in terms of technological oversight from you. You must always do your homework about the company before the interview, so definitely be prepared for this kind of question. In your answers you can suggest that a company such as theirs that works in such a sector can benefit from A, B and C suggestions. This shows that you not only understand the technology that is required for the company to succeed, but that you also understand the context in which the technology applies to them as well.

## 2. Tell us about your professional journey. What led you to this point?

**Answer:** My journey began with a strong technical foundation in computer engineering, leading me to Microsoft where I developed mobile platform expertise. This evolved into enterprise-scale leadership at Amazon, where I built Alexa AI services and transformed the Rentals business from ground up. At Visible Wireless, I led a complete digital transformation that tripled revenue while building global teams. Currently at Augment Me, I'm driving AI-first product innovation that was selected for TechCrunch Top 200 and Stanford StartX. Each role has built upon the last, from hands-on technical leadership to strategic executive oversight, preparing me to drive transformative technology initiatives at Oracle's scale.

## Notes
These kinds of questions are a great way to lay out your career. It's always a good idea to clarify how long they would like the story to be, as at this point in your career you probably have quite a long history. Try to keep the story as relevant as possible for what has been asked of you while still doing justice to the story itself. You don't want to compress your work history into a version that leaves out all the important parts, so work on encapsulating your experience into a coherent storyline that the interviewers will remember.

You don't have to retell every single job that you have ever worked in your life, but if an interesting anecdote or a conclusion that helps to make a point comes out of it, then mention it. These could even be non-tech related jobs like waiting tables or working part-time while you were studying. This shows that you have a strong work ethic and helps to contextualize your current success.

## 3. What makes you successful?

**Answer:** My success stems from a unique combination of strategic vision and hands-on execution. I excel at translating complex business challenges into scalable technical solutions, as evidenced by my track record of driving 25%+ revenue growth through AI/ML innovations. My collaborative leadership style builds high-performing teams that consistently deliver results, while my ability to navigate ambiguity and make data-driven decisions ensures sustainable organizational transformation. What truly sets me apart is my passion for mentoring future leaders and fostering innovation cultures that balance technical excellence with business impact.

## Notes
If you are not normally a person that likes to list your achievements or speak about why you are so good at what you do, then you might struggle with this type of question. Being in the executive suite of a company requires confidence, so make sure that you have answers to these kinds of questions. It's a good mental exercise to think about as well: What is it that has driven you to this point? What good habits do you have? Make a list of the best attributes that you possess and highlight them. If you aren't sure, then ask friends or family for honest feedback and take notes. Remember the most relevant points for the interview.

## 4. Describe your current role for us

**Answer:** As VP Engineering at Augment Me, I lead a high-performing engineering organization focused on AI-driven productivity solutions. I oversee end-to-end product development from MVP to market, having grown our AI-first platform that achieved TechCrunch Top 200 recognition and Stanford StartX selection. My responsibilities include strategic technical vision, team leadership across front-end, API, data science, and infrastructure domains, and driving product innovation that delivers measurable business impact. I collaborate closely with cross-functional leaders to align technical execution with business objectives while mentoring engineering talent and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence.

## Notes
These types of questions are aimed at finding out what it is that you are doing presently and how you would explain it. This isn't a good time to complain that you are doing everybody else's work, or that your current team is lazy (even if it's objectively true). Never speak poorly about your current company in an interview. Instead, highlight all of the current roles and responsibilities that you are undertaking, especially ones that relate to the role of CTO.

You are probably in a senior technical or managerial role with at this level of interview, so think about how your skills and experience would translate best into this role. If you already occupy a CTO role, then you will probably have less trouble explaining how your current skills would be a good fit for the role that you are applying for.

## 5. What value would you bring to our company?

**Answer:** I bring proven expertise in scaling AI/ML solutions and driving digital transformation at enterprise level. At Visible Wireless, I tripled revenue from $13M to $39M while reducing operational costs by 30% through modern architecture and automation. My experience building global teams and establishing Centers of Excellence would accelerate OCI's AI integration across enterprise applications. I excel at translating business strategy into technical execution, fostering innovation cultures, and delivering measurable ROI through strategic technology investments that align with Oracle's growth objectives.

## Notes
This is another opportunity for you to shine a light on your past experiences and projects. Talk about the efficiencies that you were able to introduce to your current company by implementing a new IT solution or policy. Mention the frameworks that you developed with your dev teams, or anything else that brings cost savings and streamlining in the technology space.

## 6. How do you deal with the unexpected?

**Answer:** I approach the unexpected with a structured yet agile framework: assess, adapt, execute. First, I quickly evaluate the situation's impact and gather data to understand root causes. Then I activate contingency plans while maintaining clear communication with stakeholders. For instance, during a critical infrastructure outage at Visible Wireless, I assembled a cross-functional response team, implemented backup systems within hours, and established preventive measures that improved our overall system resilience. My experience has taught me that the key to handling uncertainty is maintaining composure, making data-driven decisions, and turning challenges into opportunities for process improvement.

## Notes
Being in senior-level management is not easy, and sometimes things don't go according to plan. You will want to show the interviewers how your planning contains failsafes, backups and contingencies if the worst should happen, either operationally or during a project.

You want the panel to understand that you are dynamic and adaptive in your day-to-day work life, and that you are able to meet unexpected challenges.

## 7. How would you describe your management style?

**Answer:** I practice servant leadership with a collaborative and empowering approach. I believe in setting clear strategic vision while giving teams autonomy to execute. My style combines technical depth with business acumen - I roll up my sleeves to understand complex challenges while mentoring teams to develop their own problem-solving capabilities. At Augment Me, I've built a high-performing organization by fostering psychological safety, encouraging innovation, and maintaining accountability through regular feedback and recognition. I adapt my approach based on team dynamics, always prioritizing transparency, inclusivity, and sustainable growth over short-term wins.

## Notes
You might not see yourself as a manager, especially if you have previously held senior technical roles that focus solely on dev and technical work. Some CTO roles don't even have hands-on technical requirements. Instead, these roles may focus on policy, technological implementation and organizational culture relating to technology. But having said that, some smaller startup companies have multi-faceted roles that will require that the CTO still manages heads of departments and sometimes even key individual members on the team.

Think about how you work with people, how you lead and how you guide your teams. You might be surprised to find that you have a management style that fits in with the role that you are applying for. The key is to think about all of these elements before you sit down for your interview so that you are not caught off guard if this kind of question comes up mid-interview.

## 8. Do you have any favorite books or authors?

**Answer:** I'm an avid reader of technology and leadership books. Currently, I'm reading "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, which provides excellent insights into DevOps and IT transformation. I also regularly follow Andreessen Horowitz's AI newsletter and research papers on transformer architectures. For leadership, I draw inspiration from "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni, which has shaped how I build and lead high-performing teams. These readings help me stay current with industry trends and refine my leadership approach.

## Notes
This is a good question to have an answer for, even if it is a generic one. You don't want to come across as someone that doesn't read, so maybe have one or two ready for the interview, just in case. Suggested reading lists are widely available, such as the examples here and here.

## 9. Why are you leaving your current employer?

**Answer:** I'm seeking new challenges that align with my passion for scaling AI/ML solutions at enterprise level. While I've greatly enjoyed building Augment Me's AI platform and achieving recognition from TechCrunch and Stanford StartX, I'm ready to influence technology strategy at Oracle's scale. The opportunity to drive cloud innovation and AI integration across global enterprises represents the next chapter in my career where I can have broader impact on industry transformation.

## Notes
We all have our reasons for wanting to leave a job at some point in our lives. You don't need to go into specifics, but you can bring up the fact that you see this as a positive step up in your career. If you are coming from a senior-level position with a heavy technical background such as systems architect or head of systems development, then you can mention that you are looking to try something more challenging in the executive sphere.

CTO roles are great for candidates that have a technical background but feel like they would be better off in a more supervisory or planning role where the company's policies and operating procedures are directly influenced by their input.

## 10. What are you passionate about?

**Answer:** I'm deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and improve human experiences. In my professional life, this manifests as driving AI/ML innovations that enhance productivity and wellness - like our contactless health monitoring technology at Augment Me. Outside work, I'm committed to education and science causes, supporting initiatives that bridge the digital divide and promote STEM education. I also enjoy staying active through hiking and exploring nature, which helps maintain the mental clarity needed for strategic thinking and innovation.

## Notes
If you get to this point in an interview, you can generally assume that the interviewer is looking to get a bit more of a personal insight into what interests you as a person, and how that fits in with what you have told them thus far. Most CTOs are extremely passionate about technology, from design to implementation and everything in between.

Don't be shy about sharing some of your other passions as well, such as hobbies or worthy causes that you support outside of your professional life.

## Technical Questions

## 11. Do you still code?

**Answer:** While I don't code daily as I did earlier in my career, I maintain strong technical proficiency and regularly review code to ensure architectural decisions align with business objectives. At Amazon, I led development of AI services using Python and Java, and I stay current with modern development practices. My coding experience enables me to effectively collaborate with engineering teams, understand technical constraints, and make informed decisions about technology investments and architectural directions.

## Notes
It is unlikely that you have gotten to this point in your career without picking up at least some rudimentary coding skills, even if it has been some time since you've used them. If you haven't got any skills in that department then it might not matter, depending on how the company sees your role. If you are there as a "big picture" visionary with ideas and plans for how the company is supposed to evolve over time on a macro scale, then coding skills probably won't matter. But if you have coding experience, then your ability to understand the tech stack requirements and provide input about the direction of the system architecture of a product that is under development will be far easier for you.

Questions like this are there to assess your technical level in terms of software development. If you are working with a team of developers that need to answer to you, then you should be able to question them technically when required. If you don't have the ability to fact-check a claim, then you run the risk of being taken advantage of by teams that are under pressure.

## 12. What programming languages and development methodologies are you familiar with, if any?

**Answer:** I'm proficient in Python, Java, and JavaScript, with experience in both monolithic and microservices architectures. I've led teams using Agile and Scrum methodologies, implementing CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices. At Amazon, I established agile processes for Alexa AI development, and at Augment Me, I oversee a hybrid approach combining agile sprints with strategic planning. I'm also familiar with cloud-native development using AWS, Azure, and OCI services, ensuring teams can deliver scalable, secure applications efficiently.

## Notes
Questions like this seek to explore the level of competence you have with teams of developers that create software products. There are certain standards such as Agile, Scrum or traditional waterfall methods. Some CTOs take an active role with the managers and product owners of these teams, and some only rely on meetings and feedback to ascertain how well a project is doing.

This question will vary from company to company. Some organizations will have a heavy development requirement, while others will outsource this function. It all depends on the company.

## 13. We have an extensive internal dev team. How well do you work with developers?

**Answer:** I excel at collaborating with development teams by combining technical expertise with leadership. I establish clear communication channels, regular technical reviews, and foster a culture of innovation and accountability. At Augment Me, I work closely with our engineering teams through daily standups, sprint planning, and technical design reviews. I believe in empowering developers by providing strategic direction while removing impediments and ensuring they have the resources needed to deliver high-quality solutions. My experience building 60+ person teams at Visible Wireless and 45+ person teams at Amazon demonstrates my ability to scale development organizations effectively.

## Notes
If this line of questioning comes up, then it is safe to say that your experience and resume has brought you to the interview because you possess the qualities that the company is looking for. Dealing with a dev team is not always easy, especially if you have not been a part of the project from the beginning. Running a successful project requires tight deadline adherence and a lot of data for reports and meetings. Understanding how to get the maximum amount of progress from such structures could be important to landing the job, so be on the lookout for questions that want to know how you work with software developers and engineers.

If the team runs with Agile, then mention how important the daily standup meeting is, when to sprint and general best practice when working within the Agile framework. If they only work with traditional waterfall models, then ask why Agile is not an option. You might find that it hasn't been tried or that the incumbent CTO is not familiar with the framework. Questions like this open up many possibilities for the rest of the interview, so be ready to go into detail when you need to.

## 14. What is your technical background?

**Answer:** My technical foundation began with computer engineering, evolving through hands-on development at Microsoft and enterprise-scale leadership at Amazon. I've led AI/ML initiatives using deep neural networks, transformed legacy systems to modern architectures, and built cloud-native platforms serving millions of users. My expertise spans full-stack development, DevOps, cloud architecture (AWS/Azure/OCI), and strategic technology planning. This comprehensive background enables me to bridge technical execution with business strategy, ensuring technology investments deliver measurable ROI while maintaining architectural integrity and scalability.

## Notes
They will have all of these details in front of them, so you don't need to parrot back all of your experiences. Instead, try to distill groups of experience into a single skill that you developed over time. If you spent years as a systems engineer and then moved into software development, then speak about how the core knowledge that you picked up during your early years built a foundation for you to pursue more technical roles.

Remember that the interviewer wants to hear your take on what your experience is and how competent you are in a given domain. It doesn't hurt to think about how you got to where you are, so summarize the experiences that you have into a coherent timeline that highlights your technical background and abilities.
