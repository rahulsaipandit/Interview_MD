It is important that you do as much research about the company as you can before the interview. You need to show that you understand the company’s technological requirements as they relate to business operations, financial requirements and possible future planning. You could even have some suggestions ready for the panel if a question comes up in the interview that warrants any. It all depends on how well the interview unfolds.

1. Tell us about our company. What do we do here?
This is quite curveball for a first question, but it does happen from time to time. If you have been considered for such a high-ranking position in the company, then you might have had some preliminary discussions with a company contact ahead of time, or with a recruiter if you have gone through an agency. Either way, they could help you with some key points that you should definitely have prepared for the interview.

The interviewer generally wants to gauge how well you know the business, as it shows that you have taken a key interest in how the organization operates, and what they need in terms of technological oversight from you. You must always do your homework about the company before the interview, so definitely be prepared for this kind of question. In your answers you can suggest that a company such as theirs that works in such a sector can benefit from A, B and C suggestions. This shows that you not only understand the technology that is required for the company to succeed, but that you also understand the context in which the technology applies to them as well.

2. Tell us about your professional journey. What led you to this point?
These kinds of questions are a great way to lay out your career. It’s always a good idea to clarify how long they would like the story to be, as at this point in your career you probably have quite a long history. Try to keep the story as relevant as possible for what has been asked of you while still doing justice to the story itself. You don’t want to compress your work history into a version that leaves out all the important parts, so work on encapsulating your experience into a coherent storyline that the interviewers will remember.

You don’t have to retell every single job that you have ever worked in your life, but if an interesting anecdote or a conclusion that helps to make a point comes out of it, then mention it.  These could even be non-tech related jobs like waiting tables or working part-time while you were studying. This shows that you have a strong work ethic and helps to contextualize your current success.

3. What makes you successful?
If you are not normally a person that likes to list their achievements or speak about why you are so good at what you do, then you might struggle with this type of question. Being in the executive suite of a company requires confidence, so make sure that you have answers to these kinds of questions. It’s a good mental exercise to think about as well: What is it that has driven you to this point? What good habits do you have? Make a list of the best attributes that you possess and highlight them. If you aren’t sure, then ask friends or family for honest feedback and take notes. Remember the most relevant points for the interview.

4. Describe your current role for us
These types of questions are aimed at finding out what it is that you are doing presently and how you would explain it. This isn’t a good time to complain that you are doing everybody else’s work, or that your current team is lazy (even if it’s objectively true). Never speak poorly about your current company in an interview. Instead, highlight all of the current roles and responsibilities that you are undertaking, especially ones that relate to the role of CTO.

You are probably in a senior technical or managerial role with at this level of interview, so think about how your skills and experience would translate best into this role. If you already occupy a CTO role, then you will probably have less trouble explaining how your current skills would be a good fit for the role that you are applying for.

5. What value would you bring to our company?
This is another opportunity for you to shine a light on your past experiences and projects. Talk about the efficiencies that you were able to introduce to your current company by implementing a new IT solution or policy. Mention the frameworks that you developed with your dev teams, or anything else that brings cost savings and streamlining in the technology space.

6. How do you deal with the unexpected?
Being in senior-level management is not easy, and sometimes things don’t go according to plan. You will want to show the interviewers how your planning contains failsafes, backups and contingencies if the worst should happen, either operationally or during a project.

You want the panel to understand that you are dynamic and adaptive in your day-to-day work life, and that you are able to meet unexpected challenges.

7. How would you describe your management style?
You might not see yourself as a manager, especially if you have previously held senior technical roles that focus solely on dev and technical work. Some CTO roles don’t even have hands-on technical requirements. Instead, these roles may focus on policy, technological implementation and organizational culture relating to technology. But having said that, some smaller startup companies have multi-faceted roles that will require that the CTO still manages heads of departments and sometimes even key individual members on the team.

Think about how you work with people, how you lead and how you guide your teams. You might be surprised to find that you have a management style that fits in with the role that you are applying for. The key is to think about all of these elements before you sit down for your interview so that you are not caught off guard if this kind of question comes up mid-interview.

8. Do you have any favorite books or authors?
This is a good question to have an answer for, even if it is a generic one. You don’t want to come across as someone that doesn’t read, so maybe have one or two ready for the interview, just in case. Suggested reading lists are widely available, such as the examples here and here.

9. Why are you leaving your current employer?
We all have our reasons for wanting to leave a job at some point in our lives. You don’t need to go into specifics, but you can bring up the fact that you see this as a positive step up in your career. If you are coming from a senior-level position with a heavy technical background such as systems architect or head of systems development, then you can mention that you are looking to try something more challenging in the executive sphere.

CTO roles are great for candidates that have a technical background but feel like they would be better off in a more supervisory or planning role where the company’s policies and operating procedures are directly influenced by their input.

10. What are you passionate about?
If you get to this point in an interview, you can generally assume that the interviewer is looking to get a bit more of a personal insight into what interests you as a person, and how that fits in with what you have told them thus far. Most CTOs are extremely passionate about technology, from design to implementation and everything in between.

Don’t be shy about sharing some of your other passions as well, such as hobbies or worthy causes that you support outside of your professional life.

Technical questions
There are no easy interview questions when applying for the role of CTO because the span of topics and skills that you need to possess differ from company to company. You need to be just the right fit for such a senior role, so don’t be surprised if some technical requirements come up that you hadn’t thought of as being necessary for the role. Not many CTOs actively code, but if you are applying for such a senior role in an organization that only creates software and is composed of developers, then having experience in that type of environment would put you ahead of someone that has never worked with internal dev teams before.

11. Do you still code?
It is unlikely that you have gotten to this point in your career without picking up at least some rudimentary coding skills, even if it has been some time since you’ve used them. If you haven’t got any skills in that department then it might not matter, depending on how the company sees your role. If you are there as a “big picture” visionary with ideas and plans for how the company is supposed to evolve over time on a macro scale, then coding skills probably won’t matter. But if you have coding experience, then your ability to understand the tech stack requirements and provide input about the direction of the system architecture of a product that is under development will be far easier for you.

Questions like this are there to assess your technical level in terms of software development. If you are working with a team of developers that need to answer to you, then you should be able to question them technically when required. If you don’t have the ability to fact-check a claim, then you run the risk of being taken advantage of by teams that are under pressure.

12. What programming languages and development methodologies are you familiar with, if any?
Questions like this seek to explore the level of competence you have with teams of developers that create software products. There are certain standards such as Agile, Scrum or traditional waterfall methods. Some CTOs take an active role with the managers and product owners of these teams, and some only rely on meetings and feedback to ascertain how well a project is doing.

This question will vary from company to company. Some organizations will have a heavy development requirement, while others will outsource this function. It all depends on the company.

13. We have an extensive internal dev team. How well do you work with developers?
If this line of questioning comes up, then it is safe to say that your experience and resume has brought you to the interview because you possess the qualities that the company is looking for. Dealing with a dev team is not always easy, especially if you have not been a part of the project from the beginning. Running a successful project requires tight deadline adherence and a lot of data for reports and meetings. Understanding how to get the maximum amount of progress from such structures could be important to landing the job, so be on the lookout for questions that want to know how you work with software developers and engineers.

If the team runs with Agile, then mention how important the daily standup meeting is, when to sprint and general best practice when working within the Agile framework. If they only work with traditional waterfall models, then ask why Agile is not an option. You might find that it hasn’t been tried or that the incumbent CTO is not familiar with the framework. Questions like this open up many possibilities for the rest of the interview, so be ready to go into detail when you need to.

14. What is your technical background?
They will have all of these details in front of them, so you don’t need to parrot back all of your experiences. Instead, try to distill groups of experience into a single skill that you developed over time. If you spent years as a systems engineer and then moved into software development, then speak about how the core knowledge that you picked up during your early years built a foundation for you to pursue more technical roles.

Remember that the interviewer wants to hear your take on what your experience is and how competent you are in a given domain. It doesn’t hurt to think about how you got to where you are, so summarize the experiences that you have into a coherent timeline that highlights your technical background and abilities.
