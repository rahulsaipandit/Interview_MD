Role 1 - 
We’re looking for a decisive, business-focused technology leader to join our executive team as Vice President of Information Systems. This role is for someone who thrives on driving change, not managing infrastructure. You will be a strategic change agent, responsible for aligning technology to business goals, leading digital innovation, and enabling smarter, faster, and more efficient operations.
You’ll work closely with the executive team, use data to guide decisions, and lead a high-performing IT team to execute your vision. If you're energized by transformation, outcomes, and progress over perfection, we want to meet you.

We get that tech leaders today want more than just a new challenge. They want the right environment. This role offers long-term stability, executive visibility, and the chance to build systems that impact real people, real products, and real business success..
