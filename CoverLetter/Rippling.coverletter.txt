Dear Rippling Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Engineering Manager - Devices position at Rippling. Your vision of empowering IT administrators to seamlessly manage thousands of employees through unified device management and security resonates with my passion for AI/ML-driven product innovation and building robust enterprise platforms. With over 15 years of experience leading engineering initiatives across cloud-based SaaS solutions and scalable AI products—including three AI-first startups from MVP to market leadership—I am confident I can help advance Rippling’s mission to centralize and automate the employee experience.

In my recent role as Vice President of Engineering at Augment Me, I delivered transformative productivity products driven by custom LLM architectures. This hands-on leadership included setting engineering strategy, hiring and growing high-performing teams, and collaborating with sales and product leaders to align technical execution with business objectives—resulting in industry recognition at both TechCrunch Disrupt and Stanford StartX AI. I have a track record of championing technical innovation, nurturing collaborative cultures, and driving process excellence to meet ambitious growth goals, as also demonstrated at Visible Wireless and Amazon.

At Amazon, as Senior Engineering Manager for Alexa-AI, I led the development of advanced machine learning strategies to personalize customer experiences and managed cross-functional teams through rapid growth. I thrive in fast-paced, high-growth environments and have consistently delivered high-quality results by aligning engineering roadmaps to strategic business needs, setting clear performance metrics, and fostering continuous improvement. I am excited by the opportunity to bring this blend of technical depth, visionary leadership, and business acumen to the Rippling IT Cloud team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience can contribute to the next era of device management innovation at Rippling.

Sincerely,  
Rahul Pandit
