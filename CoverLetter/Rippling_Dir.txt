Dear Rippling Hiring Team,
I am excited to apply for the Director of Engineering – Platform position at Rippling. Your vision to deliver foundational, mission-critical platform systems that empower nearly 1,000 engineers resonates deeply with my passion for building scalable, distributed platforms and fostering high-impact engineering teams. With over 15 years of experience driving engineering initiatives for cloud-based SaaS solutions and AI-powered products, including three AI-first startups from inception to industry leadership. I am eager to help Rippling advance its strategic mission to unify and automate essential workforce operations.
In my most recent role as Vice President of Engineering at Augment Me, I set technical strategy and led the development of robust, cloud-native architectures with a sharp focus on distributed systems and automation. My leadership style centers on delivering architectural clarity among ambiguity, identifying high-leverage projects, and transforming organizational challenges into actionable, high-value roadmaps. I’ve consistently aligned product, sales, and engineering to deliver multi-quarter initiatives that ship incremental value—recognition at TechCrunch Disrupt and Stanford StartX AI attests to the impact of my approach.
Previously, as Senior Engineering Manager at Amazon Alexa-AI, I successfully managed large, cross-functional teams operating at massive scale, balancing technical execution with customer obsession and business priorities. My direct work in designing multi-layered APIs and optimizing cloud platforms for diverse stakeholder needs is directly aligned with Rippling’s mission-critical shared systems—from internal development platforms to core infrastructure and developer tools. I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments and am recognized for building and motivating high-performing, collaborative teams.
Rippling’s Platform organization stands out in its ambition to bridge executive priorities with excellent technical execution. I am excited by the opportunity to lead teams that deliver tangible, incremental product value, while optimizing world-class operations and scaling platform leverage company-wide.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my expertise in platform engineering, distributed systems, and organizational leadership can contribute to Rippling’s next era of growth and innovation.
Sincerely,
Rahul Pandit
