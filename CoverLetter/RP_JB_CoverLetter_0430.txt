Dear President and Executive Search Committee,

I am writing to express strong interest in the Chief Technology Officer role at Bezos Academy. 

Across my career, I have led multi-disciplinary, high-impact teams in engineering, AI, product, and operations—always with the goal of building technology that makes lives better. The opportunity to apply this experience to advance your mission of expanding access to Montessori-inspired preschools is deeply meaningful.

As VP of Engineering at Augment Me, I’ve built a neuro-symbolic agent powered by a proprietary LLM model and scaled it into schools across California. From research pilot to App Store launch, I’ve led the end-to-end strategy, engineering, and GTM execution. 
Prior to this, at Visible Wireless, I guided a complete digital transformation, overseeing engineering, IT, fraud, operations, and product, growing revenue from $13M to $64M. My time at Amazon Alexa-AI honed my ability to lead platform teams and deliver personalized, scalable experiences to millions—skills I now bring into mission-driven, human-centered work.

I thrive in ambiguity, lead with empathy, and work fluidly across vision, architecture, and execution. I’ve scaled platforms serving users across 20+ physical locations, built secure systems with deep AI/ML integration, and led globally distributed teams with a people-first culture. I know how to translate complex technical ecosystems into solutions that serve real people—in this case, educators, support staff, and children.

The idea of building technology that not only powers operational excellence but also directly contributes to educational outcomes inspires me. I see a future where thoughtfully designed systems elevate teachers, empower families, and create lifelong ripple effects for children in under-resourced communities. That’s the kind of impact I want to lead.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Raul
