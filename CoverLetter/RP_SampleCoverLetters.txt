9 standout tech resume tips based on 26 years in tech. I haven't seen a resume yet that couldn't be improved by at least one of these tips (based on reviewing hundreds of resumes at Microsoft, Zillow, Coinbase and others):

1. Your resume is 60% for recruiter and 40% for hiring manager. Ensure it gives both of them interest, but it has to get you a recruiter callback first.
2. Use metrics for every bullet point in job entries. It shows measurable impact. Estimate impact if you need to, and note it as such (est).
3. If you had to spend $50 USD for every word on your resume, what would you remove? Remove any word that doesn't help you get a callback (location of college, "I", coursework if you have experience, etc.).
"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away". -Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
4. Have a "tech stack:" bullet point for each job entry. This lets me see which skills you've used recently, and for how long. Please avoid a single skills section.
5. Moving into tech from another field? Focus on transferable skills.
6. Standout resumes list the business impact and then what you contributed e.g. "Increased monthly buyer volume by 5% by redesigning the UI to suggest an upsell for one-time purchases."
7. Lead with your title, not the company, for a job. You get ~1 min of the recruiter's attention, so use it wisely.
8. Please do not put education at the top if you have experience. Remember, put the most valuable stuff near the top.
9. A few colleagues and I dug into some resumes & covered a lot of these topics in a video, link in the comments.
Hope this helps ; chin up if you're looking for work. Feel free to connect/ DM if you're struggling to land gigs & need real guidance. I'm a tech career coach with 26 YOE across TPM, Eng, EM + 14 yrs coaching.
