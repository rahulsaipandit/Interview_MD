# OCI Values

## PUT CUSTOMERS FIRST
We exist to satisfy our customers. We do this by listening to them carefully, responding to them promptly, advising them honestly, and exceeding their expectations. We put doing the right thing for customers ahead of doing what they specifically say or ask for. When faced with a choice between what is easy for us and what is good for customers, customers win every time.

## ACT NOW, ITERATE
We favor action. Notice something that needs fixing? Fix it. See a gap? Fill it. Struggle with a bad process? Improve it. See room for improvement? Grow. We move quickly but deliberately, and we iterate toward better solutions. We recognize that a grungy solution now is superior to no solution at all. We keep it simple. We don't discuss endlessly, and we are scientific in our approach. We offer solutions, not problem statements.

## NAIL THE BASICS
We focus on fundamentals over flash. We recognize when we don't have the basics in place, and we diligently work to fill the gaps. We recognize that the path to advanced solutions always runs through the basics. We focus our conversations and our products on what is currently appropriate. We make progress despite not having complete information or perfect solutions.

## EXPECT AND EMBRACE CHANGE
We accept change as a given. We value people who align quickly with current priorities, who have situational awareness, and who are willing to adapt. We are not limited to priorities we set in the past. We do not hang on to outdated processes and goals, and we promote or accept new ideas fearlessly. We embrace change as an opportunity for growth and greater success.

## TAKE RISKS, REMAIN CALM
We take risks because they are necessary to our success; not taking risks is the biggest risk of all. We are logical and data-driven in assessing our risks. We react to unexpected situations by remaining calm, and then making and executing mitigation plans. We recognize that learning from our failures is part of our path to success.

## DON'T BE A JERK
We are humble in our interactions with everyone we encounter. We treat each other with dignity. We seek understanding by listening before we speak. We don't talk over each other. We provide others with opportunities to succeed, and we give constructive feedback. We help each other. We cultivate empathy.

## OWN WITHOUT EGO
We take responsibility for the state of our team, our products, and ourselves. We champion the ideas we believe in. We welcome all help and feedback, and we recognize and incorporate the best ideas offered. We are the first to admit when we are wrong. We believe that our team can produce far more together than we can as individuals. When we notice a problem we either fix it ourselves or find another owner. We never say, "That's not my job."

## EARN TRUST, GIVE TRUST
We build trust by communicating openly and transparently. We give trust easily, and we recognize that trusting each other is essential to our success. We act responsibly, and we trust others to also be responsible. We don't let occasional failures and differences in work styles undermine our trust. We learn from failures rather than seeking to place blame, and we don't invoke rank to convince others we are right.

## TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR WORK
We strive for excellence in all that we do, and we take pride in our progress. We do our best when we are proud of what we do. We identify work that needs to be done to achieve our team goals, and we communicate those goals well to the broader organization. We take responsibility for either changing our work or changing ourselves when we don't find pride in our work. We invest broadly in things that allow us to excel at our jobs, dominate in the marketplace, and delight our customers. We achieve things of value, and we value our achievements.
